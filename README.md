# 🔥 Flintlock

**Flintlock** is a firewall configuration auditing tool with both a web UI and CLI. It detects common security misconfigurations, generates scored severity reports, and optionally checks against compliance frameworks like CIS, PCI-DSS, and NIST. Deployable in minutes via Docker Compose.

## Installation

### Option 1 — Docker Compose (Recommended)

The fastest way to get Flintlock running. No Python environment setup required.

**Requirements:** Docker Desktop or OrbStack

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shamrock13/flintlock.git
cd flintlock
docker compose up --build
```

Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser.

Uploaded reports and your license key are persisted in a Docker volume across restarts. To set a custom license secret, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
FWAUDIT_SECRET=your-secret-here
```

To stop:
```bash
docker compose down
```

---

### Option 2 — Local Python

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shamrock13/flintlock.git
cd flintlock
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the web UI:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m flask --app src/flintlock/web.py run
```
Open **http://localhost:5000**

**Run the CLI:**
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m flintlock.main --file config.txt --vendor asa
```

---

## Web UI

The web interface provides the full feature set without needing a terminal.

### Running an audit
1. Open **http://localhost:8080** (Docker) or **http://localhost:5000** (local)
2. Upload a firewall config file
3. Select a vendor or leave on **Auto-detect** — Flintlock will identify it from the file content
4. Optionally select a compliance framework (license required)
5. Check **Generate PDF Report** if you want a downloadable report
6. Click **Run Audit**

### Results
- Findings are displayed inline, sorted from highest to lowest severity
- Click the **High**, **Medium**, or **Total** summary boxes to filter the results list
- Click an active filter again to clear it
- If a PDF was generated, a download link appears below the findings

### License management
- The **Licensed / Unlicensed** badge in the top-right corner opens the license modal
- Enter your license key to activate; click Deactivate to remove it

### Light / Dark mode
- Click the ☀ / 🌙 button in the header to toggle — preference is saved automatically

## CLI Usage

### Basic audit (free)

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m flintlock.main --file config.txt --vendor asa
```

### With compliance checks (license required)

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m flintlock.main --file config.txt --vendor asa --compliance pci
```

### Export PDF report (free — no license required)

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m flintlock.main --file config.txt --vendor asa --report
```

### Export PDF report with compliance checks (license required)

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m flintlock.main --file config.txt --vendor asa --compliance pci --report
```

### Supported vendors

```
--vendor asa
--vendor paloalto
--vendor fortinet
--vendor pfsense
```

### Supported compliance frameworks

```
--compliance cis
--compliance pci
--compliance nist
```

### License activation (CLI)
